# Pewlett_Hackard_Analysis
Transforming employees data from CSV files into a structured database using SQL.

## Project Overview Overview of the analysis: Explain the purpose of this analysis.
Pewlett hackard is a large compnay boasting several thousand employees, and it's been around for a long time.<br>
As baby boomers begin to retire at a rapid rate, Pewlett Hackard is looking toward the future in two ways: <br>
1. Offering a retirement package for those who meet certain criteria.
2. Starting to think about which positions will need to be filled in the near future. 

The number of upcoming retirements will leave thousands of job openings, which would require the company to have a robust employee database and a well founded transition plan to fill these many vacancies.<br>

The HR department has requested an analysis of the company's current employees information to identify the retirement-eligible employees, <br>
the number of positions that Pewlett Hackard will need to fill in the near future, in addition to the retiring titles and mentorship opportunities. <br>

This analysis will help future-proof Pewlett Hackard by upgrading the employees information from CSV files to a database using SQL.

## Objectives
The tasks in this project require transforming the employees information from CSV files to a database first, then finding answers to the following questions:
1. Who will be retiring in the next few years? and of those employees, who is eligible for a retirement package?
2. How many positions will Pewlett Hackard need to fill? 
3. How many employees will be retiring, per title?
4. Who are the eligible employees for a mentorship program?
